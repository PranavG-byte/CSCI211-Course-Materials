# Programming Assignments
Over the course of the semester, there will be 7 programming assignments. All programs must be completed individually. You should include comments documenting your code and write in a way that is readable and consistently formatted. You may be asked to explain your code to the instructor or a lab assistant during lab time or office hours, and if you are unable to adequately do so, a percentage may be taken off your grade for that assignment. Programming assignments must be turned in to [Turnin](https://turnin.ecst.csuchico.edu/) by the due date (check turn-in or Blackboard to confirm).
